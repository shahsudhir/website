             and power sources to achieve a goal.Make life easier and more convenient, 
             as well as work more productive.
              We may simply compare our current lifestyle to that of a few years ago to observe how it has provided us
               with a life of luxury and comfort. The goal of technology is to make things happen. 
               The economics of a country is also determined by the amount of technology that it has attained.
                Technology has both negative and positive effects.

                        <!--creating second heading-->
                        <p>It has made a significant contribution to the advancement of education.
                             Some of its good effects include the development of the educational system,
                              which has resulted in a significant change in the process of acquiring knowledge 
                              by supplying each and every new specification of the most recent course. 
                              We can also conduct in-depth research on a certain issue at home. 
                              You can also enroll in a variety of courses.
                              Take, for example, the recent corona virus outbreak; as a result of this pandemic epidemic, 
                              we are remaining at home and can take online classes that are just as beneficial as normal sessions.

                            <p>Education system development has both positive and negative consequences. 
                                Some students converse or view other interesting videos while taking online classes.
                                 Because ready-made answers are available, students choose to surf websites rather 
                                 than compose answers in their own unique style. Students currently like to take 
                                 photographs of their notes due to advancements in schooling.
